# MST
This is the project page of 《Mask-guided Spectral-wise Transformer for Efficient Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction》, which is accepted by CVPR 2022
[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07910)

Code and models are coming soon.

## News
Our further work [MST++](https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/MST-plus-plus) won the 1st place in [NTIRE 2022 Spectral Reconstruction Challenge](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/721#learn_the_details).
